I can’t emphasize that enough. I got to drive the latest and greatest electric scooters, and I rode around in a VR/AR-enhanced car. That was pretty cool.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i>Welcome to my new weekly fintech focused column. I have been publishing this every Sunday but on March 27, this column turns into a newsletter! So,</i><i> if you want to have it hit your inbox directly starting then, sign up </i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 was a record year for venture capital fundraising, and fintechs were the largest recipients of funding worldwide, with about 21%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all venture dollars last year going into </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/the-berserk-pace-of-fintech-investing-outshines-the-global-vc-boom/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fintech startups</span></a><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all knew – or at least some of us did, ahem – that this was likely not sustainable in the long term. Investors appeared to be backing some startups in part due to FOMO, and that’s not necessarily a good thing.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283698" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as the first quarter draws to a close, it’s clear that while in no way have fundraises come to a screeching halt, investors are starting to pump the brakes. Generally, it appears we are experiencing a market pullback – which Alex touches on </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/a-rough-draft-of-the-teetering-startup-landscape-heading-into-q2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – precipitated by a number of things, not the least of which – the conflict in Ukraine and disappointing performances by companies who went public in the last year. And fintech, last year’s rising star of venture, is not immune.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My former colleague, Joanna Glasner, at Crunchbase News published a story on March 7 indicating that venture capitalists’ enthusiasm for fintech </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/fintech-funding-declines-startup-seed-vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seems to be waning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of late. Her data point, according to Crunchbase data, was that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the two weeks leading up to her post, a total of 51 fintech companies across the globe collectively had raised $1.1 billion in seed through late-stage venture funding. That was down about 63% from the prior two-week period, during which 80 companies raised just shy of $3 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, it was truly a founders’ market, meaning that terms were more founder-friendly than ever. Many buzzy startups had their pick of investors and found themselves presented with multiple term sheets. In many cases, companies were raising money left and right at very early stages, with little more than a deck, idea and team established.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One founder of a very fast-growing fintech startup in particular, who I cannot yet name until his company’s upcoming round is announced (stay tuned), told me Friday that when raising for a round in early 2022, he saw a big difference in the “level of diligence” on the part of investors than he saw in 2021.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year, even for us, it was like, ‘look at this pretty graph, we’re growing so quickly,’ ” he recalls. “And everyone was like, ‘yeah, that makes sense, let’s invest in this.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, on the other hand, there were more questions about margins, operations, revenue coming in –  what the contribution was like on each, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went through the whole gauntlet in January and February,” he told me. “That’s why, honestly, this raise feels very satisfying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In talking with other founders, he realized that they were experiencing similar things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an absolutely different environment from Q4 of last year,” he said, “not just in terms of the level of diligence but also, in the access to capital. While there is still a lot of dry powder, it’s not as easy to get it on the specific terms you want to get it as it used to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in his view, and mine quite frankly, that’s not a bad thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders having to provide tangible evidence of a valid business model with real numbers makes more sense than, as he put it, “Hey, look at these pretty things. Give me a check for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to keep tooting our own horn, but the Equity team late last year </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">predicted this would happen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Selfishly, for the sake of my inbox (and sanity!), I am all for investors being more discriminating when it comes to which companies they decide to back. And for the founders who are able to raise in a more challenging environment, it should also – as in the case of the aforementioned founder –   feel more rewarding when they do close on those fundraises.</span></p>
<p>Note: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course in this crazy startup world, things change week by week, and my friend and fellow fintech enthusiast Nik Milanovic shared in his own newsletter on Saturday that &#8220;52 (<em>52!</em>) fintech companies raised $2.76 billion. A record for the number of funding rounds and close to the record for most funding raised by fintech in a single week.&#8221; I&#8217;m waiting to see what first quarter numbers look like or even better, second quarter numbers. There&#8217;s always a lag so fundings being announced now have likely been in the works for a little while.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Oops, Better.com did it again</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am as weary of writing about Better.com as you probably are of reading about it. But I would be remiss not to include mention of the events of the last week, which included my breaking the news about the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/07/better-com-plans-to-lay-off-about-4000-people-this-week-sources-say/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company’s mass layoff of about 3,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Astonishingly, after a fiasco of a December layoff that affected 900 people, the digital mortgage lender managed to botch things again. Affected employees shared that they </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/better-com-employees-learned-of-layoffs-when-severance-checks-appeared-in-payroll-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found out that they were getting laid off when a severance check randomly appeared in their payroll app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then was mysteriously removed. Long story short, the company had planned to conduct the layoffs one on date, changed their minds presumably due to a leak and then forgot to update the timing of when the severance checks would go out. It was a mistake that might have been forgiven if the company had not royally screwed up its December mass layoff by conducting it coldly during a Zoom call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to make clear that as any competitive reporter, I love getting scoops as much as the next journalist. However, scoops on mass layoffs are by far the least fun to get. It sucks that so many people have lost their jobs at this company in the past few months. And while market conditions (rising interest rates that have led to fewer re-financings, among other things) surely played a factor in the decision, it would be foolish not to surmise that the severe hit to its reputation has to be impacting Better.com’s ability to win new customers seeking to purchase homes and thus, its overall business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottom line: at some point, any company may have to lay off employees. But there is a big difference in handling it with compassion and respect than in handling it in a way that offends not only the employees themselves, but even casual observers. And for proof of the latter point, one need need look no further than the comments on my posts on </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maryannazevedo_bettercom-employees-learned-of-layoffs-when-activity-6906978664886759424-mC8I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter/status/1501212871920959491?s=20&amp;t=UFTXuxrW_qFu0qJXZ5t8EA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>After I wrote all of the above, I came across <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6908347418115723264/">a LinkedIn post</a> from a Better.com employee who on March 11 was asked to resign a week early after publishing an internal communication from the company on social media. Senior product designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericblattberg/">Eric Blattberg</a> publicly pushed his employer &#8212; including directly communicating with CEO Vishal Garg and CFO Kevin Ryan on LinkedIn and Slack &#8212; to provide additional severance pay and extended insurance benefits to the expecting parents who were being laid off. The company reportedly pledged to offer these employees extended COBRA benefits for 12 months, as reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/better-ceo-offers-to-cover-insurance-for-fired-expecting-parents">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2283729" style="width: 256px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2283729" class="wp-image-2283729 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-12-at-8.47.13-AM.jpg?w=246" alt="" width="246" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-12-at-8.47.13-AM.jpg 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-12-at-8.47.13-AM.jpg?resize=123,150 123w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-12-at-8.47.13-AM.jpg?resize=246,300 246w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-12-at-8.47.13-AM.jpg?resize=557,680 557w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-12-at-8.47.13-AM.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2283729" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Eric Blattberg</p></div></p>
<p>His experience illustrates Better&#8217;s efforts to make itself look better (he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ericblattberg_better-activity-6907324820921692160-cyBt">asked personally by Garg</a> to post the company&#8217;s move on social media), the disappointment that many of its former employees feel and what accountability looks like. At least Better &#8212; in this case &#8212; pledged to do the right thing.</p>
<p>As of March 12, there were reports of the extended benefits not amounting to 12 months as promised. According to Blattberg, who posted the following on LinkedIn:</p>
<blockquote><p>Better is adding to its string of corporate incompetence today with written agreements to expecting parents that differ from what a Better lawyer reading from a script promised them in a phone call, according to two of the expecting parents who noted the disparities to me earlier today. In the phone call with the laid-off employees, the Better lawyer promised four additional weeks of severance pay and 12 additional months of paid COBRA premiums on top of the standard package offered to all laid-off employees, bringing their health insurance coverage to the end of June 2023, the expecting parents told me. But in an email subsequently received by the expecting parents, the COBRA coverage was only nine additional months, bringing their coverage to March 2023, and there was no additional severance pay offered. In a subsequent communication with one of the expecting parents described to me this morning, the lawyer admitted to making a mistake, confusing the 20 days of extended severance offered to all fired employees as additional pay in their custom package, but declined to honor the prior commitment. This is, as usual, unacceptable. Better should <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=dobetter&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6908473743979732992" data-attribute-index="2">#DoBetter</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I reached out to Better.com and a spokesperson sent me <a href="https://better.com/b/march-8-letter">a link</a> to the original letter sent to employees on March 8 but declined to respond to any questions regarding health insurance benefits, citing privacy concerns.</p>
<blockquote><p>Via DMs, Eric told me: “On Tuesday morning I found myself in a unique position of privilege: still inside Better as it casually fumbled the layoffs it had spent months planning, causing an unfathomable amount of collateral damage, but not scared of losing my job, since I was sitting on an offer from Ergatta, where I’ll start as a senior product designer March 21&#8230; My only goal this whole time has been to help people. I don’t want to tear the company down, I want to shield the employees Vishal has tossed aside like they were just numbers on a balance sheet. They are not just a number. Every one of them has their own story, their own health care journey, their own reason for working at Better. And they deserve so much more respect, consideration, and support than they received this week. So I’m going to keep fighting on their behalf from the outside.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>SPAC is a four-letter word</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On EquityPod this week, Alex, Natasha and I dug into the increasing number of companies ditching their SPACs and opting to raise money instead with the latest example being Acorn, which this week announced it raised $300M at a nearly $2B valuation – in line with what it would have raised in the SPAC anyway. Companies like Acorn and Kin Insurance are doing this for a variety of reasons, including a currently unfavorable public market. But also, I think companies (and investors) are realizing what some of us already suspected – that anything that is too easy to come by is probably not worth having. Case in point: Acorn’s CEO Noah Kerner told me that when Acorn does decide to go public, it will be via the traditional IPO route. Thus, we concluded that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/spacs-are-a-four-letter-word-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPAC is a four-letter word</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, again.</span></p>
<h2><strong>LatAm and Africa’s maturing startup scenes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America raised a record amount of venture capital last year and now we’re seeing more signs of an increasingly maturing market. This week alone, I wrote about two companies that were co-founded by the founders of unicorns in the region. The first was </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/09/mara-raises-6m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mara</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a São Paulo-based startup that aims to “reinvent” the grocery shopping experience for the underserved in Latin America. One of its co-founders is Ariel Lambrecht, who also helped start mobility startup 99, Brazil’s first unicorn. The second was Yuno, a two-month-old Colombian payments startup which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/with-founders-hailing-from-colombian-unicorn-rappi-startup-yuno-raises-10m-from-a16z-and-latam-vcs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $10 million in a seed round </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of funding co-led by a16z, Kaszek and monashees.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2282603" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2282603" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2282603 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DSC9398-1-e1646879113143.jpg?w=680" alt="Yuno" width="680" height="454" /><p id="caption-attachment-2282603" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Co-founders Juan Pablo Ortega and Julian Nunez / Yuno</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to raise a relatively large seed round so soon after inception speaks to the experience of the company’s founders, which include Juan Pablo Ortega, the co-founder of on-demand delivery unicorn </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/colombian-on-demand-delivery-startup-rappi-raises-over-500m-at-a-5-25b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rappi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which as of last July was valued at $5.25 billion) and Julián Núñez, an early Rappi employee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Latin America’s startup ecosystem continues to grow, there is no doubt we will only see more founders of successful companies go on to start new ones and invest in other early-stage startups in which they see potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many parallels between LatAm and Africa, which is also seeing its startup scene grow impressively. Some of us who have been paying attention view Africa at a place currently where LatAm was a few years ago, just starting to attract more global interest and dollars – especially in fintech startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2021, Uganda’s multi-service and digital payment technology platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/18/safeboda-bets-on-super-app-to-boost-recovery-from-pandemic-slump/">SafeBoda</a> became the first startup on the continent to receive investment from the Google fund. It has now been joined by fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/">Numida</a>, which emerged as the first startup in the country to get into YC (W22). And damn, out of Ghana this past week, Dash raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/07/ghanaian-fintech-dash-raises-32-8m-seed-to-build-connected-wallets-for-africans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $32.8 million seed round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (enormous by even U.S. standards) led by Insight Partners, a New York-based private equity and venture capital firm, to build “a connected wallet for Africans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a certain energy coming out of LatAm and Africa that is refreshing and exciting to cover and I can’t wait to see what’s next in both regions.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2280791" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2280791" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2280791 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Prince-Boakye-Boampong.jpeg?w=680" alt="Dash" width="680" height="447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Prince-Boakye-Boampong.jpeg 1599w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Prince-Boakye-Boampong.jpeg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Prince-Boakye-Boampong.jpeg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Prince-Boakye-Boampong.jpeg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Prince-Boakye-Boampong.jpeg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Prince-Boakye-Boampong.jpeg?resize=1536,1010 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Prince-Boakye-Boampong.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2280791" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dash</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Fundings</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, even I was impressed with the number of global fintech-related fundings published on TechCrunch over the past week –  a testament to the kick-ass team of reporters we have all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&#8217;t include all the cool fintech funding deals that took place this last week so I’m going to narrow it down to a few from each continent along with some others that were announced that TC didn’t cover for one reason or another.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/lunar-the-nordic-neo-bank-raises-77m-at-a-2b-valuation-and-launches-crypto-trading-platform-and-b2b-payments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nordic neobank Lunar raises $77M at $2B+ valuation, launches crypto trading platform and B2B payments</span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://argyle.com/blog/b-round?"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argyle raises $55M Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make fair credit decisioning possible for every lender and consumer through real-time, user-permissioned access to employment data”</span></p>

The new round was led by 01 Advisors.</span></p>
<h2><b>In other news</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeta, a SoftBank-backed provider of next-gen credit card processing to banks and fintechs which</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/zeta-unicorn-softbank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became a unicorn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last May, and Mastercard on March 7 announced a 5-year global partnership. As part of the agreement, the companies said they will go-to-market jointly to launch credit cards with issuers worldwide on Zeta’s “modern, cloud-native, and fully API-ready credit processing stack.” Mastercard also invested in the company as part of a $30 million raise that took the company to a $1.45B valuation, according to the </span><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/zeta-raises-another-30-million-from-mastercard-others/articleshow/90057279.cms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TripActions, which was focused on travel but has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/from-0-in-revenue-to-a-7-25b-valuation-why-tripactions-275m-raise-has-fintech-to-thank/">expanded into corporate spend and expense management</a>, gave me a sneak peek at the launch of its new offering, Auto-Itemization, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which t says leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning “to automatically assign individual line items on a receipt to expense categories and then applies company policy to each line item.” This move is yet another example of how the corporate spend space is getting increasingly competitive. I also wrote this past week about a new startup called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/ex-better-com-cfo-raises-10-8m-to-build-glean-ai-or-accounts-payable-with-a-brain/">Glean AI</a>, which describes itself as &#8220;accounts payable with a brain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous tech companies have </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/07/netflix-paypal-adobe-and-others-join-tech-companies-suspending-business-in-russia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined the growing list of tech brands that are suspending their operations in Russia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amid its invasion of Ukraine. The latest batch of companies doing so includes several notable names, including financial services companies such as PayPal, Mastercard, Visa and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtel said on March 7 it is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/06/airtel-credit-card/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launching a credit card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the latest attempt from the Google-backed Indian telecom operator to make inroads with financial services as it looks to expand its offerings in the world’s second-largest internet market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna’s earnings tell us, writes </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/07/klarna-shows-that-bnpl-growth-is-not-cheap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that the BNPL market continues to expand, with consumers happy to transact more and more with the spending model. They also show us that growth in BNPL land is not cheap; Klarna’s operating costs are scaling rapidly and the company’s profitability is suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 9, Public announced that it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/09/public-buys-otis-bringing-fractional-ownership-of-alternative-assets-to-its-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchased Otis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that allows consumers to buy and trade fractional shares in individual alternative assets.</span></p>

We covered the startup’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jerry-raises-75m-at-a-450m-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a $75M round at a $450M valuation – last August.</span></p>
<p>And last but not least, I wrote about how Credit Karma, Betterment and Austin-based startup Chipper want <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/fintechs-clamor-to-give-student-loan-borrowers-relief-options/">to provide student loan borrowers with some relief options</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that’s it for this week. Please note that I’ll be out next week, enjoying spring break with my family so there will be no column published on March 20. But my newsletter formally launches on March 27 so if you haven’t subscribed yet, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now is the time!</span></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. Global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">grew 19% in 2021</a> to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion.</p>
<p>Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">generated over $100 million</a> in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps to try, too.</p>

<h3>Russia&#8217;s app economy shuts down</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2004747" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2004747" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2004747" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=1536,989 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=2048,1318 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2004747" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mika Baumeister / Unsplash</p></div></p>
<p>As the Russia-Ukraine war continued this week, the app ecosystem also saw further impacts. As businesses pulled out of Russia, the ability for Russian consumers to transact on the app stores and in apps is similarly being impacted. This week, Google <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11950272?hl=en">announced</a> it was suspending Google Play&#8217;s billing system for users in Russia in the &#8220;coming days,&#8221; which means Russian users won&#8217;t be able to purchase apps and games, make subscription payments or conduct any other in-app purchases of digital goods using Google Play in Russia. Free apps will remain available on the Play Store, the company said.</p>
<p>But the app platform themselves don&#8217;t necessarily have to shut down payments for Russian users to experience issues with billing and transactions, as some <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/03/10/app-store-purchases-may-have-been-turned-off-in-russia?utm_medium=rss">Russian App Store</a> users now are. That&#8217;s because this week <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60637429">Visa, Mastercard and American Express all announced</a> they would suspend operations in Russia in protest of its invasion of Ukraine. If App Store or Google Play users had these cards on file, they would have stopped working anyway.</p>
<p>Numerous tech companies, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/apple-halts-product-sales-in-russia-following-ukraine-invasion/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus/">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/04/google-microsoft-sales-pause-russia/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/07/netflix-paypal-adobe-and-others-join-tech-companies-suspending-business-in-russia/">Adobe, PayPal, Netflix, Snap and many others</a> have also suspended sales and operations in Russia as a result of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the humanitarian reasons for their exit, there are other costs &#8212; sanctions and complications with payments make it difficult to continue supporting Russian customers regardless.</p>
<h3>Google fixes Apple&#8217;s messaging issues with app update</h3>
<p>Alongside a wider Android update, Google announced new features designed to work around Apple&#8217;s decision to continue to support SMS instead of the newer and more modern standard RCS. This week, Google&#8217;s <a href="https://messages.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Messages app</a>, which comes pre-installed on most Android phones, was updated to address the long-standing issue where iMessage&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206894" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tapbacks</a>&#8221; weren&#8217;t delivered as emoji reactions, but were rather sent as a separate message. It&#8217;s been an annoyance that&#8217;s made chats between Android and iPhone users confusing, cluttered and far too noisy.</p>
<p>After the update, reactions from iPhone users will be sent as an emoji on text messages on Android. As on iMessage, the emoji reaction &#8212; like love, laughter, confusion or excitement &#8212; will appear on the right side of the message. (On Android, it&#8217;s the bottom right.) Android&#8217;s interpretation of which emoji to use varies slightly from iPhone, however. For instance, the &#8220;heart&#8221; reaction on Android becomes the &#8220;face with the heart eyes&#8221; emoji. And the iMessage&#8217;s exclamation mark reaction becomes the &#8220;face with the open mouth&#8221; emoji. This update is first rolling out to Android devices set to English, but additional languages will follow.</p>

<p>Related to the lack of RCS support, Google also integrated Google Photos into the Messages app to improve the video-sharing experience between iOS and Android users. While people with Android devices can share high-quality videos with each other, those same videos appear blurry when shared with those on iPhone, as iMessage doesn&#8217;t support RCS. By sending the link to the video through Google Photos, iPhone users will be able to watch the video in the same high resolution. This feature will later include support for photos, too.</p>
<p>Google thus far has been <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/googles-rcs-drama-with-apple-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very vocal</a> about Apple&#8217;s decision to avoid supporting RCS &#8212; largely because RCS adoption would allow Google to better compete with Apple&#8217;s iMessage. But Google is not wrong when it points out that Apple is not serving its own customers very well by having iMessage fall back to the older standard of SMS, which is less secure. (An odd choice for a privacy-focused company like Apple claims to be.) It also leads to an inconsistent messaging experience, where features like typing indicators, read receipts and high-res media sharing don&#8217;t work in some chats.</p>
<p>Apple, to some extent, benefits by making SMS the &#8220;worse&#8221; experience, as this can help with ecosystem <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lock-in.</a> But critics argue that decisions like this have led to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/606152/imessage-green-bubbles-sms-rcs-reactions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iMessage failing</a> as a global messaging champion, benefitting third-party messaging apps. Users worldwide have turned to other messaging apps in part because Apple chose not to compete on Android, or even keep up with the baseline features for modern-day messaging.</p>

<li><strong>Telegram, an app being <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/03/07/telegram-messaging-app-is-at-the-heart-of-the-ukraine-war-how-to-use-it-and-is-it-safe">heavily utilized</a> amid the Russia-Ukraine war right now, was updated</strong> with a <strong>download manager</strong> that will place a new icon in the Search bar to show files are actively being downloaded; users can then go to the Downloads tab in Search to view, manage, pause and resume all downloads or individual items, as well as adjust a download&#8217;s priority. It also introduced a <strong>new attachment menu</strong> where you can rearrange or remove items in an album while previewing it before sending. And notably, Telegram users can <strong>now broadcast from livestreaming tools like OBS Studio and XSplit Broadcaster,</strong> turning any Telegram channel into a TV station of sorts. This latter feature is timely, given how <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/11/1085427380/ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-zaporizhzhia">livestreams have become an important part</a> of documenting the war. Other tweaks included the rollout of semi-transparent headers and footers on Android, a redesigned login flow on macOS and Android, new t.me pages, <strong>and a way to share t.me links to your phone number</strong> that opens a chat with you, so you can chat with someone without sharing your phone number with them.</li>

<p>Amazon’s Clubhouse competitor arrived this week. The retail giant on Tuesday launched a new mobile app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1586403838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amp</a>, which allows people to create live “radio shows” where they can act as a DJ by taking callers and playing tracks from its catalog of tens of millions of licensed songs, ranging from classic titles to today’s music.</p>
<p>While most Clubhouse rivals have focused on talk &#8212; like live podcasts &#8212; Amazon’s Amp differentiates itself by providing access out of the gate to a broad music catalog. That means Amp users can play DJ, streaming and chatting about their favorite songs and artists to establish themselves as a creator. Or they can use the app to talk about anything else — like sports or pop culture, for example — but do so while also curating a selection of music for their listeners and taking live callers.</p>
<p>The app will also feature shows from Nicki Minaj, Pusha T, singer-songwriter Tinashe, electronic artist and violinist Lindsey Stirling, Travis Barker, Lil Yachty and Big Boi; well-known personalities Tefi Pessoa and Nikita Dragun; popular radio hosts Zach Sang, Kat Corbett, Christian James Hand, and Guy Raz; and writers from music and culture publication The FADER.</p>
<p>The app is available in a limited U.S. beta, and users will need to seek out an invite to get in.</p>

<p>Subscription newsletter platform Substack announced this week it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/09/substack-introduces-a-new-ios-app-for-reading-android-launch-coming-soon/">launching</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/substack-reader/id1581650857">a dedicated app on iOS</a> for reading that organizes all your Substrack email newsletter subscriptions in one place. Substack writers, meanwhile, will benefit if their readers install the app, as they&#8217;ll get reliable delivery of their publications and their other media in one place. Users can also choose to turn off emails (!!!) if they want to get the publications just inside the app. The company said it&#8217;s working to develop more features to better support podcasters, videomakers, community leaders and more in addition to readers and writers. The company previously <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/new-reader-homepage?s=r">introduced</a> a Substack Reader on the web, which offered a similar way to organize and aggregate all your subscriptions in one place; now that offering is mobile.</p>
<p>The app, however, has a bit of Google Reader-like vibe to it, in the sense that it&#8217;s allowing a user to build out a reading list of their favorite publications. But while Reader was built on open standards, like RSS, Substack is trying to lock you inside their world &#8212; one which increasingly feels like a publisher&#8217;s own content platform.</p>
<p>Plus, Substack readers didn&#8217;t necessarily need a dedicated app to read their newsletters outside of their inbox &#8212; plenty of reading apps, from RSS readers like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> to new startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/matter-raises-7-million-series-a-to-build-a-better-reading-app/">Matter</a>, allow for this functionality, too.</p>

<p><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox early, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">subscribe here.</a></em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283520" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, AngelList Venture closed its first tranche of institutional funding since spinning out </span><a href="https://www.angellist.com/blog/angellist-confidential-2020-highlights" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on its own in 2020.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The $100 million round was led by Tiger Global and Accomplice, valuing the business at $4.1 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t necessarily expected. The round comes just weeks after the organization’s CEO, Avlok Kohli, told me</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that the company didn’t need venture money, a stance that AngelList, which was founded in 2010 and split into AngelList Venture and AngelList Talent in 2020 &#8212; each with their own CEOs and boards &#8212; has long embraced. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DyJ80y8cWa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/angellist-series-c/">AngelList Venture takes on rare capital at a $4 billion valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AngelList Venture takes on rare capital at a $4 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/angellist-series-c/embed/#?secret=b1qVb8XJC3#?secret=DyJ80y8cWa" data-secret="DyJ80y8cWa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its business of helping other startups raise money, AngelList itself has largely resisted the siren call of venture capital and operated on what others might consider to be a shoestring budget. Indeed, prior to raising this massive new round, the larger company, pre-spin out, had raised $124 million across multiple rounds over the years &#8212; some previously unannounced. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likely, its views on venture funding stem in part from an earlier experience involving founder Naval Ravikant, who once felt so cheated by the sale of an earlier company he co-founded, Epinions, that he sued its powerful venture backer, Benchmark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But also, as Kohli explained during our recent chat, AngelList&#8217;s philosophy has long been that companies that raise too much money can hamper their growth as hiring takes center stage, slowing down other aspects of the business. “If your entire focus is on shipping velocity and shipping great products, growing headcount is actually counter to that,” he said. So what changed, and inspired AngelList to pursue the Tiger stamp of approval? The hedge fund has been planting seeds in the early-stage market, making the investment all the more interesting. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Deal of the week </strong></h2>
<p>I want to give a shout-out to Mara, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/09/mara-raises-6m/">a startup out to “reinvent” the grocery shopping experience</a> for the underserved in Latin America that raised $6 million this week. The startup offers supermarket items at a wholesale price, and lets folks order a basket via websites &#8212; instead of hard to access phone apps. It also has delivery points where customers can pick up and pay for their groceries.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why it’s important: </strong>Grocery delivery is a tough business, let alone one that is hoping to make it cheaper and more convenient for low-income families. That’s why I was interested in the fact that the company is avoiding the growth at all costs mindset. Mary Ann reports that Mara is adopting an approach where it focuses on one area at a time, making sure it is “gross margin break even” there before moving on to another area.</p>

<h2><strong>Community beyond capitalism </strong></h2>
<p>No buzzword should ever go unchecked, which is why<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/09/you-cant-buy-a-community-so-make-it-worth-it/"> I decided to dig into the true impact of community</a> &#8212; and how capitalism both complicates and changes its connotation within startups. Bringing people together to rally behind a product and idea isn’t a new phenomenon, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why it’s important:</strong> After much attention, we’re starting to see which community efforts amount to actual impact. This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/lolita-taub-ganas-ventures/">Lolita Taub launched her own venture capital firm</a>, powered by and from the community that she has aggregated over her past decade in startups. Ganas Ventures, her pre-seed and seed-stage firm, is even raising the rest of its debut fund from Taub’s followers.</p>

<h2><strong>SPAC is a four-letter word (again)</strong></h2>
<p>On Equity Live this week, we came to the conclusion that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/spacs-are-a-four-letter-word-again/">SPAC is a four-letter word again. </a>The route to going public is no longer in vogue, with companies such as Better.com and Kin tossing aside their plans (and Acorns raising lots more capital after pausing its interest in them).</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why it’s important: </strong>The IPO window is pretty much closed at this point. While I’d expect to see startups staying private longer as a result, the late-stage market is softening. Uh oh. Late-stage companies that need more capital may not be able to access some if they don’t have rock-solid business models. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/05/early-stage-startups-pivot-season/">Expect pivots to continue. </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“There’s three different things that make up a vlog,” David Dobrik, then a rising YouTube star, explained to Casey Neistat, a veteran YouTuber and filmmaker. Neistat’s camera pans to show a swimming pool, where a member of Dobrik’s ensemble, the Vlog Squad, balances on a jet ski, attempting to toss a basketball from half-court distance over his shoulder and into a hoop. “It’s like, interesting things, cool visuals and funny stuff. And this is not funny unless someone gets hurt.”</p>
<p>As David’s following grew, his stunts became more elaborate. People got hurt. It wasn’t funny.</p>
<p>When Neistat began filming his first feature-length documentary “<a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2022/films/2054014">Under the Influence</a>” in 2019, the older, wiser YouTube star wanted to capture the phenomenon of David Dobrik, the then-22-year-old and <a href="https://rewind.youtube/about/">fifth most-viewed</a> creator on the platform. Neistat followed Dobrik as he moved into multi-million dollar homes, performed for crowds of screaming college kids and bought his friends Teslas as casually as if treating them to lunch at Chipotle (where they could have ordered <a href="https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2019-04-03-Chipotle-Offers-Free-Delivery-And-Teams-Up-With-David-Dobrik-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day">Dobrik-branded burritos</a>).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283706" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, as “Under the Influence” premieres at SXSW, Neistat is telling a far different story than the one he set out to document. In fact, he threw out two years of post-production work once his already-controversial muse became a bonafide persona non grata online.</p>
<p>“I definitely started the process of making this movie in good faith. I think it was undeniable, David’s phenomenon. That’s not to praise the content he was making itself, but certainly, the phenomenon that was David was something absolutely extraordinary,” Neistat told TechCrunch. “It was clear that his content, I think to say it generously, was walking a very fine line, even back then.”</p>
<p>At the time, Dobrik was on top of the world, filming prank videos with celebrities like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMt0wpPfyY">Kylie Jenner</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VF0GEf3S0I">Justin Bieber</a> and transcending the bounds of social media to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxZS0gv7J5g">make guest appearances</a> on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” But his pedestal was built on the sheer luck that he got away with so many dangerous stunts. Eventually, Dobrik went far enough that it toppled over.</p>
<p>Within two years – as Neistat continued to document – Dobrik found himself at the center of two serious scandals. In March 2021, Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">reported</a> that a woman in one of his videos claimed to have been sexually assaulted by a Vlog Squad member on the night they filmed a video about group sex.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dobrik lost sponsorships with brands like Hello Fresh, SeatGeek, EA Sports and DoorDash, he was <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/david-dobrik-youtube-demonetized-1234938946/">demonetized</a> on YouTube, and he stepped down from Dispo, the venture-funded social photo-sharing app that he co-founded. Early investors including Spark Capital, Seven Seven Six and Unshackled committed to donate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">any potential profits</a> from their investment in the app to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault.</p>
<p>But all the while, Dobrik was hiding another secret: The year before, a risky stunt went so wrong that his friend and collaborator Jeff Wittek nearly died.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2283708" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2283708" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2283708" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UTI_002_wcolor-1.jpg?w=680" alt="David Dobrik documentary film still" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UTI_002_wcolor-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UTI_002_wcolor-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UTI_002_wcolor-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UTI_002_wcolor-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UTI_002_wcolor-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UTI_002_wcolor-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UTI_002_wcolor-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2283708" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Casey Neistat</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>“There was no such thing as a ‘power dynamic’ to me”</strong></h2>
<p>Dobrik’s stunts were always dangerous. When Neistat first visits his mansion in 2019, Dobrik greets him at the door with a flamethrower, which he wields haphazardly around his home as though it’s a nerf gun.</p>
<p>“There was never a naivety on my part, even in my relationship with David, that everything was perfect,” Neistat told TechCrunch. “Part of my interest in telling this story was to try to reveal how this is done, and how he tried to get away with what he was getting away with.”</p>
<p>Yet documenting the highs and lows of Dobrik’s at-times dangerous pursuits is arguably its own flavor of sensationalism.</p>
<p>Early in the documentary, when Jonah (whose real name is Nick Antonyan – he’s called Jonah in the vlogs because he looks like Jonah Hill, and his body type often makes him the butt of hurtful jokes) drives a motorbike over a ramp and into a pool, he punctures a hole in his stomach.</p>
<p>“Let’s get Jonah to the hospital, and David, let’s get this footage into editing,” a Vlog Squad member told Dobrik.</p>
<p>Jonah proved to be okay after his trip to the emergency room, yet this near-miss didn’t appear to be a wakeup call for Dobrik, who continued to pursue the next biggest stunt, regardless of whether it could put his friends – who also acted as business collaborators – in danger.</p>
<p>“I remember very clearly, one of the first questions I asked David was, ‘These people that we’ve seen in your videos, are they your friends or your coworkers?’ And his response, that’s included in the movie, is… He hesitates,” Neistat said. “It caught me off guard, because I expected him to be almost offended at that question.”</p>
<p>Dobrik’s newfound wealth gave him access to flamethrowers, motorcycles, jet skis and heavy machinery for riskier stunts, but unlike Hollywood, where stunts are heavily regulated on set, Dobrik was not required to hire safety professionals, so he didn’t.</p>
<p>“It’s certainly an understandable suggestion to draw parallels between the content that David made and something like Jackass, but there’s one extraordinary, bold line between the two, and that line is one of consent,” Neistat told TechCrunch. “Steve-o is a friend of mine, and every member of the ‘Jackass’ team knows exactly what they’re signing up for. They know what the cost is going to be to them physically. They know what their liability is, they know what their return is, they know what the transaction is. It is consensual, and I think that is the extraordinary difference between the things that you see on YouTube – especially when you’re looking at sort of an ensemble cast of characters like David’s videos – and something like ‘Jackass.’”</p>
<p>Of course, accidents still happen in Hollywood, but on YouTube, there’s no possible way that a platform could regulate what happens during filming, even if it wanted to.</p>
<p>Even though YouTube bans “<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/1063345?hl=en">dangerous or threatening pranks</a>,” the guideline is usually only enforced to stop people from participating in potentially deadly viral challenges. When YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/youtube-will-ramp-up-enforcement-of-its-policies-against-dangerous-challenges-and-pranks/">added the rule</a> in 2019, the company specifically referenced trends like people <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/01/13/teens-are-daring-each-other-to-eat-tide-pods-we-dont-need-to-tell-you-thats-a-bad-idea/">eating Tide Pods</a> or trying to light themselves on <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/fire-challenge-tiktok-trend-13-year-old-injured-1596392">fire</a>.</p>
<p>While Dobrik’s pranks could (and did) cause serious injury, his videos weren’t removed from YouTube.</p>
<p>“We don’t allow pranks that make victims believe they’re in serious physical danger – for example, a home invasion prank or a drive-by shooting prank,” YouTube <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/1063345?hl=en">wrote</a> at the time. “We also don’t allow pranks that cause children to experience severe emotional distress, meaning something so bad that it could leave the child traumatized for life.”</p>
<p>Many of YouTube’s biggest stars have followed this same formula – they start with low-budget pranks, and as their channels pick up steam and bring them riches, there’s no boundary to the potential for their antics. It’s a form of wish-fulfillment for young viewers – if you and your friends lived in a big mansion with unlimited cash, what mischief would you get up to?</p>
<p>“This endless pursuit of sensationalism is where I think someone like David lives. The more sensational it was, the crazier the stunts, the more views it had,” Neistat said. “A number of creators on YouTube have pursued a similar trajectory, and it has never ended well.”</p>
<p>YouTube’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/trends/2021/us/">top trending video</a> of 2021 featured Jimmy Donaldson (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA">MrBeast</a>) following a similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/mrbeast-squid-game-creator-economy-viral/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">pursuit of sensationalism</a> – he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bqk6ZUsKyA">buried himself alive</a> for fifty hours, though Donaldson did hire a medic to keep watch on standby.</p>
<p>Another prominent YouTuber, Logan Paul, faced consequences for prioritizing shock value over his responsibility as a creator with a massive platform. In conversation with TechCrunch, Neistat brought up Paul’s “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/youtuber-logan-paul-sued-over-suicide-forest-video-n1252610">suicide forest</a>” scandal, in which the YouTuber visited a Japanese forest known to be a common site of suicides and made jokes about a dead body he encountered. YouTube <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42644321">cut ties</a> with Paul, who <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/948026294066864128">said</a> his poor judgment was a result of being “misguided by shock and awe.”</p>
<p>Similarly, YouTube <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/david-dobrik-youtube-demonetized-1234938946/">demonetized</a> Dobrik’s channels in the aftermath of the sexual assault allegations against a member of his Vlog Squad. Recently, Dobrik <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2022/01/03/david-dobrik-no-youtube-money-three-years/">said on his podcast</a> that he still isn’t making money on YouTube. TechCrunch asked YouTube if Dobrik’s channels remain demonetized, but did not receive a response.</p>
<p>On screen, Neistat asks Dobrik, “There’s something gross about a guy using his social media platform and his influence to attract young women, and then you make a video out of it. Did any of that occur to you as wrong or inappropriate?”</p>
<p>“At that time, there was no such thing as a ‘power dynamic’ to me,” Dobrik replies in the documentary – an admission that he never considered how his position as a super-sized social media star could change the way people interacted with him. “I didn’t see that as anything weird. Looking back at it now, it’s really gross.”</p>

<h2><strong>“I should be dead”</strong></h2>
<p>A month after the Insider article was published, another bomb dropped: Vlog Squad member Jeff Wittek revealed in his own YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTuJLt6tz1I">documentary</a> that, the previous year, Dobrik had swung him around on an excavator. The construction equipment requires a license to operate, and Dobrik didn’t have that or any other safety supervision for the stunt.</p>
<p>Dobrik subsequently lost control of the heavy machinery and, as Neistat depicts in a horrifyingly gory scene, Wittek slams into the side of the crane and breaks open the side of his face. Since then, Wittek has had at least nine eye surgeries and cut ties with Dobrik, who continues to pay his medical bills.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t be here anymore,” Wittek tells Neistat in the film. “I should be dead.”</p>
<p>Neistat told TechCrunch that Dobrik has seen the documentary, but they haven’t spoken about it – in fact, they haven’t spoken since their final interview, which took place after Insider published sexual assault allegations against Dobrik’s collaborator. TechCrunch asked Dobrik’s team for comment on the film, but did not hear back before publication.</p>
<p>“Jeff’s accident had a tremendous impact on how I was conducting interviews, and my professional relationship with David,” Neistat said. “And then when Kat’s article came out, that was a dramatic, dramatic shift in how the movie was captured.”</p>
<p>“It was very heavy, and you can hear in the tone of my voice just how it kind of became a little bit more contentious, and I became more confrontational with him. In that final interview, I think one of the first questions I asked him was, ‘Do you feel responsible?’”</p>
<p>In a podcast published days before “Under the Influence” would premiere at SXSW, Dobrik expressed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRMQg2dEo_0">remorse</a> for these egregious incidents, which the documentary centers around. Yet in the documentary, he doesn’t seem to grasp the implications of his mistakes.</p>
<p>“The [Insider article] was written because this place wanted clicks, like, it wasn’t written because the company’s going and looking after the victim and making sure she’s okay,” Dobrik said to Neistat in the documentary.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Wittek made a podcast episode called “Dear David…” about why he was no longer friends with the figure who propelled him to fame.</p>
<p>“I’ll have life-long brain injuries, and I saved him from fucking everything. He could’ve got deported, he could’ve got put in jail for manslaughter, he could’ve got sued for everything,” Wittek said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz2SNSHes1M&amp;feature=youtu.be">his podcast</a>. “I took it on the chin, and then to see [the documentary]&#8230; that just made me completely lose all respect for this guy, and lose all hope he could ever turn around and become a better person.”</p>
<p>Dobrik’s career has certainly taken a sizable hit, but he continues to post on YouTube, where he still has 18.3 million subscribers. He even has a Discovery show called “<a href="https://www.discovery.com/shows/discovering-david-dobrik">Discovering David Dobrik</a>,” a docuseries in which he travels the world with his friends. The show was <a href="https://twitter.com/Discovery/status/1435377343229431809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1435377343229431809%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insider.com%2Fdavid-dobrik-vlog-squad-discovery-travel-show-deal-2021-9">announced and filmed</a> after both of these scandals came to light.</p>
<p>Even in his first interview with Dobrik, Neistat observed that the young star looked haggard and overworked. “It’s prescient to see it now,” Neistat told TechCrunch. But it’s not a coincidence that so many top YouTubers like Dobrik, Donaldson and Paul follow this same trajectory: they strive to make each video more engaging than the last, but eventually, there seems to be just two paths. Either you burn out, or you make a career-altering mistake before you take a beat to slow down.</p>
<p>“I think that there’s always a pursuit. It’s relevant for a musician – how do you keep your music interesting?” Neistat said. “But what makes individuals like David Dobrik different is that their pursuit is not coming out with the next song or making the next movie. Their pursuit is how can I be more sensationalist? And that is a very, very, very dangerous pursuit, because the minute you achieve something that was crazier than the last, you then have to go past that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virtual reality is about to launch in series production cars this summer, starting with Audi sedans and SUVs.</p>
<p>Holoride announced Saturday at the SXSW tech, music and film conference in Austin that its headset-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/audi-spins-out-holoride-to-put-vr-in-every-car/">virtual-reality entertainment system</a> will debut in June in certain Audi models with the latest MIB 3 software. The announcement is a milestone for the startup that spun out of Audi several years ago; it also signals an increasing interest among automakers to find new ways to capture the attention of consumers.</p>
<p>The Holoride system intertwines backseat passengers&#8217; physical world with augmented reality for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/holorides-in-car-vr-solution-is-the-best-thing-at-ces-2019/">motion-synchronized journey</a> as the car moves along. The system is brand agnostic, which means other automakers can support it, too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283596" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Holoride&#8217;s partnership with Terranet, a Swedish ADAS software development company, allows for the VR system&#8217;s sensors and software stack to capture and interpret the environment quickly and accurately. Terranet&#8217;s VoxelFlow system calculates VR movement based on data points received from the car.</p>
<p>The software to build virtual-reality content for cars is also open source, allowing developers to create content and eventually cash in.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2283745 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg" alt="holoride VR set in Audi" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/holoride_duo-image.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a></p>
<p>For now, the only additional cost to use the VR system is a headset, but there is limitless potential for carmakers and developers to generate revenue from car owners by selling subscription services or charging for certain features. The global automotive AR and VR market is projected to reach $674 million by 2025, according to an Allied Market Research report.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bringing VR entertainment into series production cars is also an initial step toward developing the type of content passengers may consume once driverless cars arrive. Holoride and Audi, which owns part of the Munich-based VR company, hope to stake an early claim in the tech stack of autonomous cars &#8212; and the nearer term prospect of capturing more revenue from its human-driven vehicles.</p>
<p>The future market opportunity for in-car content and entertainment is vast because once driverless cars begin to roll out, everyone will become a passenger, Holoride contends.</p>
<p>Being first also allows them an opportunity to establish a new media category Holoride calls &#8220;Elastic Content.&#8221; Whether you&#8217;re operating a flying saucer or a submarine from behind the headset, the VR system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/holorides-in-car-vr-gaming-system-leaves-the-track-for-the-real-world/">adapts to the car&#8217;s movements</a> so that your VR journey mimics the acceleration, turns, and stops of the car.</p>
<p>The opportunities are boundless, according to Holoride and Audi. Passengers will be able to buy or collect NFTs, supported by Elrond&#8217;s blockchain, while visiting the virtual world. Location-based games could connect the virtual world to locations or events in the physical world, like Pokemon Go.</p>
<p>Of course, motion sickness is a key concern in VR. Holoride says that syncing with the vehicle&#8217;s movements reduces the symptoms.</p>
<p>The Munich-based company, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/audi-spinoff-holoride-collects-e10m-in-series-a-led-by-terranet-ab/">raised $12 million</a> last year for a valuation of $30 million, debuted a prototype of the VR system at CES in 2019, taking reporters for spins around the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The colorful, virtual reality world was created with Disney and other partners. Some journalists felt dizzy, while others reported feeling fine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sachin Bansal’s Navi Technologies, a fintech startup that offers customers insurance and loan products, has filed for a $440 million IPO as the 40-year-old entrepreneur who made his money by kick starting the e-commerce wave in the country once again makes a bold choice.</p>
<p>Navi Technologies’s initial public offering will consist entirely of new shares, and the startup may consider raising a pre-IPO placement, it said in its draft prospectus filed with the local regulator Saturday.</p>
<p>The IPO comes at a time when tech stocks – or most others – have plunged in recent months. All tech startups including Zomato, Paytm, Nykaa and PolicyBazaar that went public last year have traded at their lowest share prices in recent weeks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283743" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But for Navi Technologies, which has been eyeing an initial public offering for more than a year, there’s also a sense of urgency in making the company public. The startup’s most recent attempt to raise money from SoftBank and other investors at over $4 billion valuation crumbled following its inability to secure a license to become a bank, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Navi offers digital personal loans, home loans and credit against property in the lending space. It also provides customers with health insurance and digital asset management with a passive fund focus. Thus far, the startup is nearly entirely funded by Bansal.</p>
<p>Billionaire Bansal, who co-founded Flipkart over a decade ago and was pushed out of the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/walmart-confirms-16b-flipkart-investment-giving-it-77-in-indias-e-commerce-leader/">before its sale to Walmart</a>, and Navi have largely stayed off the limelight. The <a href="https://www.icicisecurities.com/Upload/ArticleAttachments/Navi%20Technologies%20Limited%20-%20DRHP.pdf">draft prospectus</a> (PDF), for the first time, offers color on Navi&#8217;s various businesses and its financial health.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2283747 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/navi-ipo.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="308" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/navi-ipo.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/navi-ipo.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/navi-ipo.jpg?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/navi-ipo.jpg?resize=768,348 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/navi-ipo.jpg?resize=680,308 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/navi-ipo.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“With its in-house NBFC (non-banking lender) arm, AI/ML-based underwriting and digital-only D2C approach, Navi has been able to exercise control over its lending products from sourcing, underwriting to the collection and offer a smooth experience to customers,” the startup describes itself in the draft prospectus.</p>
<p>Navi says it is using technology to serve customers who have not been served otherwise. The startup ensures “instant loan disbursals, offer digital home loans at low-interest rates, leverage technology to manage fraud and credit default risks, use data analytics to train its lending algorithms to offer attractive pricing and better loan account management and exercising both digital and field collections to its advantage.”</p>

<p>The startup – which has reported a consolidated profit of $9.2 million in FY21 on revenue of $17.8 million – says its personal lending and retail health insurance products are helping customers sign up in less than 4.5 minutes and 2.5 minutes, respectively.</p>
<p>In 21 months since its launch, Navi’s personal loans business has served over 481,000 customers in 84% of Indian zip codes and extended 2 million Indian rupees to them with up to 84 months of tenure. The ticket size of these loans is $665.</p>
<p>“As of December 31, 2021, 61.17% of our health insurance policies sold were approved without any human assistance on the Navi App. Further, we have developed our chat-based interface which ensures that our customers are served seamlessly throughout their buying journey,&#8221; the startup adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We offer health insurance premiums through EMIs, where a customer can pay a fixed amount every month towards their policy has made our products attractive and affordable. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, our GWP was ₹667.60 million, of which ₹63.26 million was from the retail health insurance segment. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, we had issued a total of 220,491 insurance policies of which 27,800 were retail health insurance policies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electrifying a car like the two-door Mini Cooper seems like a brilliant, forehead-slapping &#8220;why didn&#8217;t we think of this before&#8221; kind of concept and Mini certainly agrees.</p>
<p>The brand has been toying with the concept since 2009, with the limited run of the Mini E, a program designed to field test the viability and attractiveness of an all-electric Cooper.</p>
<p>Advancements in technology and demand for such a car led to the Mini Cooper SE, a fully electric version of the manufacturer&#8217;s stalwart two-door hatch. It&#8217;s a first step towards the brand&#8217;s recent self-imposed deadline to be fully electric by 2030.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2281821" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The upshot: The Mini Cooper SE is a jaunty car with the playful performance fans of the brand expect, but sadly &#8211; and a bit on the nose &#8211; retrofitting a long-in-the-tooth hatchback with an electrified powertrain doesn&#8217;t get it very far in 2022.</p>
<h2>Nuts and volts</h2>
<p>The Mini Cooper SE is a full battery electric version of the third-generation Cooper or Hatch, as it&#8217;s known in other markets, which debuted just two short years ago. The combustion guts of the cheerful two-door have been replaced with its new electrified innards.</p>
<p>The battery sits in place of a fuel tank, cables run through the transmission tunnel and the car&#8217;s drive unit occupies most of the engine bay.</p>
<p>In lieu of a standard turbocharged engine, the Mini is fitted with an electric motor powering the front wheels, delivering 181 horsepower and 199 pound-feet of torque.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In comparison to the rest of the Coopers in the lineup, it&#8217;s about on par with the Cooper S and it&#8217;s turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder power plant. Power for the SE is stored in a 28.9 kWh battery, providing the SE with roughly 114 miles of range on a full charge. Mini claims the Cooper SE can charge 80% of the battery in roughly 35 minutes on a level 3 DC fast charger, and as much as 20% per hour on a level 2 charger. Basic home outlets can trickle out 2% per hour.</p>
<h2>The tech</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2281886" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2281886" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2281886 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-infotainment.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2281886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>In terms of baked-in tech, the Mini Cooper SE has the basics covered. An 8.8-inch touchscreen is the main interface for drivers and passengers. This houses the entertainment and navigation functions, the latter of which Mini provides with real-time traffic status displays. As one familiar with other cars within the BMW family, the Cooper SE has pages of settings that can be sifted through to customize a myriad amount of little functions. Everything is arranged in a &#8220;live widget&#8221; format, which manifests as big colorful graphics available with a swipe of the finger. If it&#8217;s not your cup of tea, Apple CarPlay is available as an alternative.</p>
<p>For safety and driving assists, there is an adaptive cruise control system as well as lane departure warnings. There&#8217;s even forward collision detection that keeps an eye out for both cars and pedestrians.</p>
<h2>The UX</h2>
<p>Since it was redesigned and reintroduced in its current, BMW-produced form, nu-Mini has always been careful to emphasize the spirited dynamics of the Cooper. As such, it&#8217;s incredibly driver-friendly in many fundamental ways.</p>
<p>For starters, the driving position is much roomier than it appears to be. The cockpit conforms snugly around the driver and passenger seats, making both positions feel connected to the jovial plaything they&#8217;re seated in. For the driver, a simple display sits behind the steering wheel which avoids clutter by providing the minimum amount of required information. Apart from the current speed, two gauges spell out the state of charge, how it&#8217;s being used and if it&#8217;s in a regenerative state. Between these two readouts and the ever-changing range estimates, drivers will be eyeballing this for most of the drive, sometimes too much, in fact. Thankfully, the always-on collision detection throws up a bright red graphic on the same display when they are approaching another vehicle, reminding them to look up.</p>
<p>This Mini retains the circular dashboard display that once housed the speedometer. An homage to this unique characteristic of the original Mini, it feels more vestigial than ever in the era of ubiquitous infotainment screens. The 8.8-inch touch screen sits like a square peg in a round hole, with piano black buttons occupying the negative space. The widget UI is appropriately colorful and cheerful, but it&#8217;s at the detriment of intuitive navigation. Oftentimes, it&#8217;s not particularly clear how to get to a selected function at the cost of precious driving attention.</p>
<p>The rest of the physical inputs are very chunky and substantial, from the aircraft-like switches to the dials for the HVAC. Everything is laid out in a reasonable, functional way and with these, it&#8217;s rare that you are searching for that moment&#8217;s desired input. This is fortunate, because driving the Mini SE is an active experience.</p>
<h2>On the go</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2281887" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2281887" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2281887 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg" alt="mini cooper se - full view" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mini-cooper-alex-k-full-view.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2281887" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alex Kalogianni</p></div></p>
<p>Though not as mini as the Minis of old, the Cooper SE is still a compact, agile car that lays its character on pretty thick, while backing it up with sprightly performance. Pair that with the superior torque delivery of an electrified ride and the car darts around enthusiastically like an automotive Pikachu from Pokémon.</p>
<p>Reps from Mini are quick to point out the &#8220;go-kart&#8221; feel of the car&#8217;s handling, and they&#8217;re not wrong to do so.</p>
<p>Probably now more than ever thanks to an electrified powertrain, the Cooper&#8217;s performance is responsive and never feels like it&#8217;s too much of a handful. Its torque is readily available, and though the 7-second 0 to 60 mph sprint time isn&#8217;t going to get anyone hot under the collar, its ability to dart into corners or gaps in traffic is commendable.</p>
<p>Rarely does the Cooper SE get out of sorts, and how this lands depends on the individual. Thrill-seekers may desire a little loose-wheel squirreliness, but others will be happy the car stays within its limits.</p>
<p>There are four driving modes baked into the Cooper SE. In its default &#8220;Mid&#8221; mode, the EV balances efficiency with engagement, providing power when a heavy foot is delivered onto the throttle but otherwise conserving as much juice as possible. &#8220;Green&#8221; limits available acceleration energy and also softens the pedal&#8217;s input, while &#8220;Green+&#8221; does this while also shutting off some of the creature comforts for maximum power-saving. &#8220;Sport&#8221; ups the throttle sensitivity while offering up as much power as possible, at the expense of battery power, naturally.</p>
<p>All of this is to say your mileage will literally vary when using these modes. Each changes the dynamics of the car in a very tangible way. There&#8217;s also two levels of regenerative braking active at all times. By default, the Cooper SE starts in the more aggressive setting that allows for one pedal driving, but it can be switched to a less effective and more natural setting.</p>
<p>Available modes such as these are commonplace, but the Mini&#8217;s 100 or so miles of range greatly influences the driving experience. Due to this limited range, it&#8217;s easy to find yourself repeatedly readjusting things.</p>
<p>A typical journey looks like this: Whatever mileage estimate the Mini displays in Mid, it&#8217;s always going to be a more attractive and anxiety-reducing one in Green, so you try to cruise in Green mode as much as possible, occasionally switching to Mid when traffic picks up. Sport is always lingering in the background as a very indulgent treat, because it means even a short burst of whimsy costs a precious amount of the dwindling charge. Meanwhile, it&#8217;s not uncommon to fiddle with the regen switch to balance out comfort with stretching out the miles.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll hear arguments that people don&#8217;t typically drive over a hundred miles a day anyway, which is true, but even with a robust home charging solution, the concern of getting caught short diminishes the enjoyment of the car.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>In terms of future EV development, we have an idea of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/what-the-bmw-minis-electric-future-looks-like/">what Mini has in mind</a>, and we know that parent company BMW plans to make Mini fully electric by 2030.</p>
<p>Efforts seem like a slow burn towards a rapidly approaching deadline, but Patrick McKenna, Department Head for Mini Product Planning gave TechCrunch some insight as to why. &#8220;The specifics of how we&#8217;re transitioning is still being formulated, but what we&#8217;re focusing on in the coming years is strategic flexibility, the ability to still offer internal combustion and battery electric vehicles,&#8221; McKenna told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The [Cooper SE] runs on the same production line as the internal combustion F56 hardtop,&#8221; McKenna continued. &#8220;[This flexibility] allows us to produce the cars right next to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a manufacturing standpoint, it makes sense to be in a position to satisfy two different kinds of customers, but this strategy is inherently limiting. Unless there are some advancements to the efficiency of the battery used, the Cooper SE&#8217;s largest issue physically doesn&#8217;t have room to improve. Since the powertrain was derived from the now-discontinued BMW i3, it&#8217;s unclear if this will happen anytime soon.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s tons to like about the Cooper SE, especially if you&#8217;re into Mini&#8217;s style of whimsy. If you&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s still hard to ignore how well the automaker continues to keep its cars consistently fun to drive.</p>
<p>And yet, the conversion of the existing car to EV and its lackluster range makes it a hard sell, particularly in an era where sporty BEVs with ample battery life aren&#8217;t as rare as they were even just a handful of years ago. Mini, a brand that leans heavily on its past to inform its style, may have an all-electric future ahead of it, but its efforts in the present feel a few steps behind the competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Tuesday, AngelList Venture closed its first tranche of institutional funding since spinning out <a href="https://www.angellist.com/blog/angellist-confidential-2020-highlights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on its own in 2020.</a> The $100 million round was led by Tiger Global and Accomplice, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/angellist-series-c/">valuing the business at $4.1 billion.</a></p>
<p>It wasn’t necessarily expected. The round comes just weeks after the organization’s CEO, Avlok Kohli, told me that the company didn’t need venture money, a stance that AngelList, which was founded in 2010 and split into AngelList Venture and AngelList Talent in 2020 – each with their own CEOs and boards – has long embraced.</p>
<p>Despite its business of helping other startups raise money, AngelList Venture itself has largely resisted the siren call of venture capital and run on what others might consider a shoestring budget. Indeed, prior to raising this massive new round, the larger company, pre-spin out, had raised $124 million across multiple rounds over the years &#8212; some previously unannounced.</p>

<h2>The startup growth paradox</h2>
<p>This week, The Exchange spent a good amount of time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/a-rough-draft-of-the-teetering-startup-landscape-heading-into-q2/">highlighting changes in the startup market</a>. To summarize, the value of tech companies is being re-drafted by investors, and it appears that some of the speculative enthusiasm that drove startup results in 2020 and 2021 has disappeared.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283501" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For many companies, near-term market changes aren&#8217;t a big deal. Some startups have enough cash to power through and will solve falling revenue multiples with sustained growth.

<p>But for a good number of startups, the situation looks different. Here&#8217;s where some startups find themselves today:</p>
<ul>
<li>They raised a historically outsized round in 2020/2021 at a high price thanks to the market being flush with speculative capital.</li>
<li>They spent heavily on hiring and growth goals, leading to stiff burn rates through the end of 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> bad of a situation, provided that the startups we&#8217;re talking about have enough cash to get through 2022. By then perhaps valuations for tech companies may have recovered somewhat. But with companies raising faster than ever before last year &#8212; sometimes three times in a single year!&#8211; some startups lashed themselves to growth targets that were inherently cash-consumptive. This means that many 2020 and 2021 raises won&#8217;t get companies through this full year.</p>
<p>That means they have to raise again, timing be damned.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Are late-stage startup valuations going to suffer this year?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/25/are-late-stage-startup-valuations-going-to-suffer-this-year/embed/#?secret=bLGyw4cgoY#?secret=RFplaaOt87" data-secret="RFplaaOt87" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So, some upstart tech companies now find themselves looking at the following two options: grow more slowly, saving cash, or keep the pedal to the floor at the expense of cash. What&#8217;s tricky is that <em>neither</em> option may work out for them. How so?</p>
<ul>
<li>Startups that raised at high prices with the expectation of rapid growth that are now facing a potential next-round valuation that doesn&#8217;t match their expectations can limit growth to conserve cash. This would provide a longer runway to their next funding round. However, this will harm their growth rates, leading to a far lower value attached to their equity, limiting fundraising options and bringing into question their long-term viability.</li>
<li>Startups that raised at high prices with the expectation of rapid growth that are now facing a potential next-round valuation that doesn&#8217;t match their expectations could keep spending to grow, limiting their cash balance. This would lower their cash runway, but keep their growth rate comparatively high. However, with investors signaling that profitability matters, simply spending to grow might wind up a Faustian bargain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the startup growth paradox. It is solved by going back in time and taking on capital at lower prices, or perhaps with a more limited growth plan. However, given that last year was a record for startup fundraising in terms of volume and prices, it&#8217;s a bit late for that.</p>
<p>Precisely how startups will handle this challenge will probably be a key narrative in 2022.</p>
<p>There are some ameliorating factors. Investors could fund their existing portfolio companies with extension rounds at flat prices. That would be dilutive to startups, but far from lethal. And startups can leverage some methods of growth that are less expensive &#8212; product-led growth, etc. &#8212; in hopes of managing good revenue expansion without terrifying operating losses.</p>

<p>But such forms of growth are not easy to pursue, even for companies built with such go-to-market methods in mind from day one. How to pivot from other sales methods isn&#8217;t clear for startups that may suddenly want to find a way to attract new top-line without hiring more sales staff or spending more on advertising.</p>
<p>Sorry for all the bad news lately, but consider it the tonic to last year&#8217;s party. This is the hangover.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bored Apes Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs announced Friday that they have acquired the rights to the CryptoPunks and Meebits NFT collections from creator Larva Labs.</p>
<p>Bored Apes and CryptoPunks are the two most valuable NFT collections by market cap, and hold a combined worth at a minimum of some $3.6 billion at current prices. Yuga Labs has been rumored to be in fundraising talks over the past several months but has not made any official announcements.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal were not announced.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283656" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CryptoPunks and Meebits NFTs are owned by members of the community, but the intellectual property rights of the characters had long (and controversially) been owned by the projects&#8217; creators. With this announcement, Yuga Labs signaled that they will be giving full commercial rights of the NFTs to the individual holders; they notably won&#8217;t be transferring the full copyright, but is a step further than Larva Labs ever went and something owners had long desired.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some big news to share today: Yuga has acquired the CryptoPunks and Meebits collections from <a href="https://twitter.com/larvalabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LarvaLabs</a>, and the first thing we’re doing is giving full commercial rights to the NFT holders. Just like we did for BAYC and MAYC owners. <a href="https://t.co/lAIKKvoEDj">pic.twitter.com/lAIKKvoEDj</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1502420714527334406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;We’ve long admired CryptoPunks, and the work of the project’s founders, Matt &amp; John. They’ve pushed NFTs and the broader crypto world forward, and we’re honored to carry the brands they’ve built into the future we’re building at Yuga,&#8221; a <a href="https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1502420717664710657?s=20&amp;t=scR3p-uTpceCV18AgGf2Kg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> from the Yuga Labs Twitter account reads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The CryptoPunks project was launched in 2017 with 10,000 NFTs claimed by users for free; it is generally seen as one of the earliest NFT projects and one of the most influential. In late 2020 prices of the pixelated portraits began to spike with the rarest selling for millions of dollars and the cheapest now selling for nearly $200,000. In May of 2021, the Larva Labs founders released a follow-up project called Meebits, banking tens of millions of dollars in primary sales within hours of launch.</p>

<p>The Larva Labs founders have almost fully divested from the project at this point, with Yuga Labs detailing in a blog post that they had also acquired 423 CryptoPunks and 1,711 Meebits from the company, leaving the founders with just a few of each in addition to their generative art project Autoglyphs which was not part of the deal.</p>
<p>Yuga Labs has taken a more aggressive path toward actively building out the community of the Bored Apes project, revealing a partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is, however, not an acquisition of Larva Labs&#8230; As for what’s next for us, we never talk about that until it’s ready, but in general we’re excited to get back to what we do best, which is working on weird new stuff,&#8221; a <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/blog/2022-3-11-18-0/yuga-labs-acquires-cryptopunks-and-meebits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> from the Larva Labs founders reads.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Friday, March 11, 2022! Oh <em>boy</em> was that a week. It was full and busy and, now, finally, over. We have your full news digest below, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/meet-your-co-founder-or-find-your-next-gig-at-tc-sessions-mobility-2022/">stay hype about TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility</a>, because it’s looking increasingly lit. – <a href="twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/europe-pegasus-investigation/">EU to investigate state use of spyware</a>: </strong>The Pegasus mobile spyware is causing headaches in Europe for more than just the folks who found themselves targets of the software. The European Parliament voted this week to “investigate allegations that European member states acquired and used” Pegasus, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/a-rough-draft-of-the-teetering-startup-landscape-heading-into-q2/">How the startup game is changing</a>:</strong> With young tech companies doing everything from biology to space tech to software to consumer crypto trading algorithms, it’s hard to keep tabs on what’s going on for “startups” as a category. But after spending a few weeks collecting data on the matter, TechCrunch landed on something akin to a summary of how things have changed for the tech companies hoping to build the future.</li>
<li><strong>The latest tech response to Russia’s Ukrainian invasion: </strong>Non-Russian tech companies continued their work to isolate the Russian state after its government invaded neighboring Ukraine. YouTube is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/youtube-is-now-blocking-russia-state-affiliated-media-globally/"> now blocking Russian state-affiliated media around the world</a>, and we took a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/as-tech-companies-suspend-sales-in-russia-what-is-the-actual-business-impact/">how the move to halt sales in Russia will impact tech concerns more generally</a>. In response, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/russia-instagram-block/">Russia has decided to block Instagram</a>, which we presume is more a defensive move than an offensive one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/sorenson-ventures-keeps-focus-on-enterprise-with-new-150m-fund/">Sorenson Ventures raises $150M fund</a>: </strong>The Utah-based firm has made it to a second fund, raising a new vehicle that is 50% larger than its last. TechCrunch writes that Sorenson backed some 30 enterprise startups with its first capital pool. Guess what it’s investing in this time around? Yep, more of the same.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/100ms-secures-20m-to-power-next-generation-of-live-video-apps/">Today in good startup names</a>:</strong> What do you think 100ms does? Something involving speed? Yep! 100ms works with live video applications, where speed – latency, really – matters a lot. And the company just raised a Series A shortly after announcing its seed round.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/stripe-gets-friendly-with-crypto-again/">Stripe hearts crypto</a>:</strong> While not Stripe’s first rodeo with crypto, this latest news bump appears more substantial than those it put out in the past. Stripe, a public company in all but name, has built out a way for its customers to “buy and store crypto tokens, cash out, trade NFTs and handle compliance workflows like Know Your Customer.”</li>
<li><em>Stripe, go public!</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/byju-raveendran-invests-400-million-in-his-edtech-startup/">Byju Raveendran puts $400M of Byju Raveendran’s cash into Byju’s, the startup founded by Byju Raveendran</a>: </strong>The infusion was part of an $800 million round, meaning that the well-known Indian edtech company has oodles of cash to play with. TechCrunch reports that the company is now worth some $22 billion, a simply staggering sum.</li>
<li><em>Byju’s, go public!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And speaking of going public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/spacs-are-a-four-letter-word-again/">the Equity crew has a fun episode out today</a> that includes notes on life <em>after</em> SPACs for startups that considered the method of going public but ended up saying <em>hell naw.</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283539" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hot on the heels from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/diamond-age-raises-8m-to-speed-up-home-construction-with-3d-printing-and-robot-arms/">its $8 million fundraise just a few months ago</a>, <a href="https://www.diamondage3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diamond Age</a> is back for a top-up, with a $50 million Series A financing to continue its mission to make homeownership more affordable by using 3D printing and robotics technologies to make home construction significantly cheaper &#8212; a welcome change in a world where there&#8217;s a 7-million-home shortage in the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p>The company describes itself as a &#8220;full-stack robotics startup,&#8221; building a suite of tools that is designed to take the place of more than half of the manual labor associated with building a new home. The side-effect of adding a slice of robotics to the mix is that homes that used to take nine months to build can now be instantiated into existence in a month or so. The company has now developed 26 end-of-arm robotic tools, on top of a 3D printing system that can print concrete for exterior, interior and roof structures.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The funding round was led by <a href="https://www.primemoverslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Movers Lab</a>, which focuses on science-driven innovations. In particular, the investor gets excited about startups re-inventing energy, transportation, infrastructure, manufacturing, human augmentation and agtech. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Seed investors Alpaca VC, Dolby Family Ventures, Timber Grove Ventures and Gaingels all invested above their pro-rata and are joined by Signia Venture Partners. Perhaps most promisingly for the company&#8217;s founders, 20% of the round was made up of home builders and land developers; it&#8217;s always a good sign when potential customers invest in startups. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283618" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since its previous fundraising round, Diamond Age has massively advanced its tech, making it possible to print and build a 2,000-square-foot single-story home. No doubt impressing the investors and adding some fuel to the valuation fire, the company delivered its first scaled version of its system, as well as a full-scale 3-bed, 2-bath house in 11 months &#8212; 4 months ahead of schedule. This led to the company’s first contract with a national homebuilder, details of which the founders were tight-lipped about for now &#8212; but expect that announcement to come along soon as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Affordable housing is impacting people on a global scale. As the average age for first-time homebuyers has moved from mid-twenties to mid-thirties, there’s an increased demand for more rental property &#8212; forcing the entire hierarchy of renters into a more competitive market for &#8216;quality&#8217; housing,&#8221; said Jack Oslan, co-founder and CEO of Diamond Age. &#8220;Helping the next generation of homebuyers get into their first house faster helps the entire ecosystem of housing.”</p>

<p>Diamond Age will use the funding to continue scaling its robotics platform and execute on its first commercial contract to build homes. The company has already doubled in size and plans to add more engineering and fabrication talent. This will help Diamond Age partner with home builders and developers to turn home-building into an on-demand product and provide buyers with more options when designing their home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Diamond Age’s Factory in the Field system brings automation to the construction site to back fill the massive labor shortage in the home construction industry,&#8221; said Prime Movers Lab General Partner Suzanne Fletcher. &#8220;Jack and his team have hit key milestones ahead of schedule and are transforming the way production homes are constructed, so it was an easy decision for Prime Movers Lab to lead the company’s Series A.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alex Iskold is &#8220;one of the luckiest people you&#8217;ve ever met,&#8221; he says from his office in New York. He&#8217;s the co-founder and managing partner of a venture firm, <a href="https://www.2048.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2048 Ventures</a>. He previously spent five years with Techstars as the managing director of its New York City program, where he invested in and helped more than 100 startups.</p>
<p>Iskold has also cultivated a vast network of contacts &#8212; contacts that he is putting to use for the second time in two years. The first time, Iskold and fellow VC <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mindabrusse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minda Brusse</a> called on these friends and acquaintances to fund families in need during the pandemic, forming a kind of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/your-money/philanthropy-charity-giving-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human blockchain</a>, as The New York Times described it. According to Iskold, the effort ultimately spread $3 million to roughly 1,000 families, he says.</p>
<p>Now, Iskold is reviving that earlier operation, dubbed the <a href="https://www.1kproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1K Project</a>, to provide much-needed help to Ukrainian refugees who&#8217;ve fled the country, as well as families that remain trapped within its borders, are suddenly jobless and, in a growing number of cases, no longer have a place to call home.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I never thought I would have to restart the 1K Project, but as soon as I realized what [Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine] would mean,&#8221; he started making calls, he says.</p>
<p>Like many people, Iskold is horrified by a war that, one month ago was hard to imagine yet has already displaced <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60555472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 2 million people</a> and caused <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-economic-adviser-says-war-damage-tops-100-billion-so-far-2022-03-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $100 billion</a> in damage. But it&#8217;s also personal. Iskold is Ukrainian. He spent the first 19 years of his life in the country, and he still has many cousins and friends and acquaintances there. Indeed, he says a third cousin and her family escaped almost immediately after Russian troops entered the country, while desperate others have stayed because they have sons and husbands who are between the ages of 18 and 60 and thus <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/02/25/russia-invasion-ukraine-bans-male-citizens-leaving/6936471001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forbidden from leaving</a> the country.</p>
<p>Iskold&#8217;s network has been quick to heed the call for help. Since tweeting out the news 11 days ago that he was resuscitating the <a href="https://www.1kproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1K Project</a> to funnel money to Ukrainians, a network of 30 volunteers, from developers to data analysts, has sprung into action to spread the word and ease the path to helping sponsor and recipients reach each other.</p>
<p>As Iskold explains it, &#8220;The most powerful thing we&#8217;ve built is a distributed network [that quickly enables] sponsors and families to apply. Interested parties can find the forms on our site. There is a lightweight vetting process for sponsors and more strict vetting process for recipients. But once the sponsor and the family are approved, they get matched, and the sponsor is texted or emailed directions on how to fund the family through [the only money transfer service] <a href="https://wise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wise.com</a>.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The donations, made in $1,000 increments, are not tax deductible. For those who want to donate larger amounts and to receive a tax credit for them, Iskold says the group is using an outfit called <a href="https://opencollective.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective.com</a> as its fiscal sponsor. (To donate to five or more families, for example, 1K Project will send someone instructions on how to donate to OpenCollective; it will then dispatch the money to the families through that vehicle.)</p>
<p>More volunteers &#8212; and donors &#8212; are needed. 1K Project &#8212; which Iskold describes as &#8220;razor focused on helping families who have three-plus children,&#8221; including women who are either in the war zone or who are otherwise displaced with their children &#8212; already has more demand than it can meet. &#8220;We have a ranking algorithm and we&#8217;re shortly going to fund 1,200 families,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But we have 12,000 applicants and we can&#8217;t fund everybody; we just don&#8217;t have enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for how the money is being deployed, there are &#8220;so many use cases,&#8221; says Iskold, who credits the Ukranian banking system for continuing to function in the face of complete chaos.</p>
<p>Some families have used the funds to move to safer parts of the country, he notes; others who are already outside of Ukraine are using it buy food for their children.</p>
<p>In all cases, the families are in highly distressed situations, he says. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from a bunch of families where they&#8217;re sitting on their couch one day and the next day, the bombs completely blew away their homes and they have nowhere to live and they need to figure out how to get out of that place with [not much more] than a T-shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stories pain him. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting thank-you messages and constantly crying,&#8221; he says. Worse, he knows there&#8217;s only so much that his sprawling and eager network can do. &#8220;There is just a ton of problems that we&#8217;re hearing about that we&#8217;re not able to help with, like ammunition for the army or medical supplies.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the midst of everything else, he worries about people he knows, particularly when they become hard to track. &#8220;You know how you see green dot [on your smartphone] and then sometimes you don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>He is meanwhile doing what he can &#8212; and seemingly making a dent. Since spinning up the <a href="https://www.1kproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1K Project</a> anew, people have donated $1 million to more than 800 families, help that is &#8220;exceptionally helpful for refugees&#8221; who&#8217;ve left everything behind in a flash.</p>
<p>Alas, that need looks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/11/world/ukraine-russia-news#russian-forces-bombard-civilian-areas-in-strategic-port-city-of-mykolaiv-an-official-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poised to balloon</a>. &#8220;If families are displaced within Ukraine and lucky enough to get into refugee centers,&#8221; says Iskold, &#8220;a lot of stuff is taken care for them. If they&#8217;re not in refugee centers, they need food, they need help.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For many first-time founders, determining the size of the market in which they hope to compete is one of their biggest challenges.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t launched a successful startup, but I have helped write several pitch decks. Each time, the team&#8217;s collective anxiety increased when we needed to calculate TAM.</p>
<p>It was always the last slide we worked on.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283454" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For most products and services, TAM is presented in nine figures or more, but when you&#8217;re sitting around a kitchen table eating cold pizza while planning to disrupt a billion-dollar market, these numbers can create a lot of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>Calculating TAM, SAM and SOM sounds like an existential exercise, but there’s no need to dread it “if you approach market sizing methodically,” says Marjorie Radlo-Zandi, a veteran investor and entrepreneur.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/09/how-to-calculate-your-startups-tam-sam-and-som">In her latest TC+ post</a>, she broke down the steps required to capture these key metrics that will “show prospective investors how they stand to gain from investing in your company, and put yourself in the best possible position to achieve your goals.”</p>
<p>This article also covers how to hire and pay for custom market research, the best people to ask for advice, and the importance of only using credible sources. And don&#8217;t worry about those eye-popping, billion-dollar figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only be concerned if the number is small,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The TAM number gives investors an overall macro perspective of your company’s potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend.</p>

<p>When Intel bought Mobileye in 2017, the chipmaker paid about $15.3 billion, 43x Mobileye’s prior-year revenues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This year, Mobileye is set to return to the public markets as Intel seeks to spin it off, but the IPO market is so frozen, all eyes are on how well the computer vision company is received.</p>
<p>“There may be less of a hype premium attached to Mobileye when it does list. Still, the company does have good growth and operating income attached to a very, very high-tech product, so there is good reason to expect the company to have material value.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Both my co-founder and I have E-2 status. We need to find a quick visa option because a VC investment will dilute our equity, and we will no longer be eligible for the E-2. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We are looking at International Entrepreneur Parole as an option since we would easily qualify based on the investment we’re expecting, but we’re concerned about timing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I know IEP is a new option; how long is it taking? Can it be expedited? Should we consider alternatives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Fast-Flying Founder</strong></p>

<p>Companies like GitLab, Hashicorp and Samsara that produce developer tools have seen soaring multiples in recent years, but those numbers are falling back to earth.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Boldstart Ventures partner Ed Sim noted that Gitlab&#8217;s valuation has fallen from $15B to $5.5B, and Hashicorp has dropped from $14B to $6.7B.</p>
<p>This prompted Alex Wilhelm to take a closer look at these &#8220;developer-first&#8221; companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might think that with venture capital piling into the technology business model category and a number of recent IPOs to point to, the market for such work would be hotter than ever. And yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Writing a white paper used to be an academic pursuit, but for crypto startups, these documents are drafted with investors in mind.</p>
<p>Potential project supporters want to understand a company&#8217;s underpinning technology, but today&#8217;s white paper also needs a transparent product roadmap, a tokenomics overview and details about how the proceeds will be used.</p>

<p>In early February, VaynerMedia CEO Gary Veynerchuk told CNBC, &#8220;I put out content every week saying that 98% of [NFT] projects are going to zero. Most of the behavior I see in NFT buying reminds me of the way people bought Beanie Babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>On February 23, a planned NFT auction at Sotheby&#8217;s was canceled shortly before it was scheduled to start after the consigner posted to Twitter, &#8220;nvm, decided to hodl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I&#8217;m seeing much less discussion about non-fungible tokens in my Twitter timeline, and that includes supporters and detractors.</p>
<p>Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm found several data points suggesting &#8220;that the NFT market is slowing along a number of axes, indicating, at a minimum, that growth in the hot sector has come to a halt.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To get a look at how development agency Intent tailors its approach to client needs, we spoke with Wojciech Borkowski, head of business development, and CTO Peter Tuszynski.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Based in Warsaw, Poland, <a href="https://withintent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intent</a> assists a wide variety of companies with everything from product design and UX to development and deployment of connected devices. It caters to diverse sectors, with customers such as sleep tracker ŌURA, trivia game HQ, Tomorrow Health, Samsung, Mercedes-Benz and Nike.</p>
<p>To get a look at how Intent tailors its approach to client needs and how the company helps clients get their products from inception to the market, we spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wborkowski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/wborkowski/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646772926365000&amp;usg=AOvVaw26V49KgJyajja9xr867kxu">Wojciech Borkowski</a>, its head of business development, and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petertuszynski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/petertuszynski/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646772926423000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1VU2mTkURyXuziMjTUNjRY">Peter Tuszynski</a>.</p>
<p><strong>As a development shop, how involved do you get when helping clients validate ideas before they bring their apps to market?</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2281021" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Our service goes beyond being a typical dev shop, as we align with clients to be &#8220;think partners&#8221; — this is the methodology we use when approaching any new project. We help clients to validate ideas, as their success is crucial to the outcome of a project. We act as a second pair of eyes and assess the project and its assumptions through our frameworks and techniques, such as design sprints and lean canvas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We only accept a low percentage of clients who approach us, because we are highly specialized in delivering digital solutions where a physical device is present.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s important to have a battle-tested process for product validation. Our clients are often very focused on the hardware side, which requires us to be more diligent when working on the software/firmware side of the project to ensure everything will work together smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe the intake process for new clients? How do you assess their requirements, and what information do you need before you can share an estimated project timeline and budget?</strong></p>
<p>We apply our own processes partially or fully depending on where the client is at with their product development. Our PM and UX teams also conduct workshops, as we typically work with net-new project types and things that we haven’t done before.</p>
<p>We need to understand the budget, project objectives, and timelines to help the client navigate the project and get it to fit their requirements. This is done through workshops and a few methodologies that we use to get us and the client aligned in terms of knowledge and project scope.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What&#8217;s a ballpark quote for the average project, and how frequently do you communicate with clients once the work is underway?</strong></p>
<p>Each project is different, but the majority of projects fall into the six-figure range.</p>
<p>We have developed different ways of working that we apply based on the project type and client expectations. We deploy a range of tools to keep clients up to date, and this is typically accompanied by different meeting types, such as developer dailies and weekly or biweekly demos and planning sessions, which follow a scrum format.</p>
<p><strong>What percentage of your clients are non-technical people who have an idea, but no coding experience? How much of a limitation is that for launching an app?</strong></p>
<p>Around 50% of our clients are non-technical founders starting a net-new project, which means Intent acts as a &#8220;think partner&#8221;, or, in effect, a CTO for their project. Many successful startup founders have no technical background, but do possess great product, sales and marketing skills, so being non-technical is not a limitation when working with the right technological partner.</p>
<p>We not only act as a partner, we can also help them build their own internal team, even going as far as hiring a CTO.</p>
<p><strong>As a consultant, is helping clients avoid scope creep part of your role? If so, how do you help manage their expectations? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s why we emphasize understanding their customer personas and user journeys. We then work with the client to scope out their MVP using industry-leading workshop methodologies and processes.</p>
<p>We’re very diligent in prioritizing the features that make their way into the prototype, and we actively avoid reinventing the wheel by using many ready-made components that we can quickly integrate into the project without spending much time doing custom development.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your average timeline for delivering a working app after you&#8217;ve signed a contract? What do you need to accomplish before you can share wireframes?</strong></p>
<p>Each project is very different, as we try and prioritize the development of brand new ideas that take us out of our comfort zone. That said, we can typically build an MVP for any product within four months.</p>
<p><strong>Do you also oversee the QA process? Can Intent help clients navigate the approval process for app stores?</strong></p>
<p>Not only do we oversee the QA process, we deeply believe in engaging QA engineers from the earliest days of the project so they can get a head start on designing the overall testing strategy and creating test cases.</p>
<p>Additionally, our staff has a deep understanding of the approval process for a given app platform, along with the guidelines that must be followed. Our engineers regularly attend conferences like Apple’s WWDC or Google’s IO, where they get to meet and talk with folks who are responsible for the approval process so they can give better support when any unexpected issues arise during the application submission.</p>
<p><strong>Do you provide any marketing services? </strong></p>
<p>We don’t offer pure marketing services to clients, but can help them figure out personas for their client types, which in turn helps them identify the best distribution channels.</p>
<p><strong>Do you work on both hybrid and native apps? What can you tell us about the benefits and drawbacks of each, and when do you encourage clients to go hybrid? </strong></p>
<p>We work on both native and hybrid apps. Since we specialize in building apps that talk to various peripheral and connected devices, native technologies prevail. However, we have working experience with nearly every hybrid stack out there (React Native, Flutter, etc). In fact, we maintain some of the most widely adopted open source Bluetooth Low Energy libraries for ReactNative.</p>
<p>Every project is different and a lot of the work we do is net-new, meaning it hasn’t really been done before. There isn’t a silver bullet stack we recommend to our partners. However, our team has found Flutter is great for deploying prototypes quickly. For apps that require the native look and feel, especially on iOS, we tend to lean towards a native toolchain.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever turned down a client? Are apps you won’t work on, e.g, games, dating, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, we only accept a low percentage of clients who approach us, because we are highly specialized in delivering digital solutions where a physical device is present. The industry of connected devices is still maturing, which means we had to coin our own term, &#8220;PxD,&#8221; which we describe as the &#8220;intersection of physical and digital.&#8221; A good cultural fit is also a big factor on both sides, as no one wants to butt heads throughout the project.</p>
<p><strong>Who owns the source code once the project is complete? How is the source code managed?</strong></p>
<p>The intellectual property rights of the project and code ownership belong to our partners. We do not practice vendor lock-ins. We found the best way to retain a client is to deliver outstanding work backed by years of experience.</p>
<p>Typically, we use Github to store all our source code and integrate it with continuous integration pipelines so that each piece of code our engineers commit to the repository is automatically tested and built. For some specific projects, we have aligned with our partner’s setup, which include Gitlab and self-hosted git repositories.</p>

The DVR allows customers to record programs from over 80 channels, including broadcast networks ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX, which they can then rewind and fast-forward through &#8212; like a traditional DVR offers.</p>
<p>Previously, users would receive up to 50 hours as part of their base plan, with the option to upgrade to 200 hours with the Enhanced Cloud DVR add-on for an additional $9.99 per month. This also offered them the ability to rewind and fast-forward through recordings, which was not available to those on the base plan.</p>
<p>With this change, Hulu is dropping the storage limits on the DVR for all Hulu + Live TV subscribers and making rewind and fast-forward available as part of the offering, too. Each recording will now be available to users for up to nine months, when previously, the oldest recordings were automatically deleted when users ran out of space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283448" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As of April 13, those who had purchased the add-on will see a reduction in their monthly subscription fees, while everyone else will see the Unlimited DVR added to their service automatically. This might not immediately be noticeable as the upgrade will only introduce minor changes to the Hulu user interface. For example, there will not be an indication about how much space is left on the DVR, as that&#8217;s no longer needed.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s decision to make the Unlimited DVR free with the base plan is one it hopes will drive more subscribers to its service and make the upgrade to the Live TV tier more appealing to standard Hulu subscribers. Today, Hulu + Live TV is already one of the largest live TV streamers, with 4.3 million paying customers, but the traditional pay-TV subscriber base is still much larger.</p>
<p>A number of live TV streamers, including Hulu + Live TV and rivals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/youtube-tv-hikes-price-to-64-99-per-month-following-new-channel-additions/">YouTube TV</a>, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/hulu-will-increase-the-price-of-its-live-tv-service-again-on-december-18th/">continued</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/hulus-live-tv-service-gains-14-new-channels-as-result-of-viacomcbs-deal/">raise</a> prices for their base plans over the years. This left some consumers wondering if these sorts of services still have value when compared with traditional pay-TV providers, like cable and satellite, where hundreds of channels are available.</p>
<p>Plus, when you tack on upgrades &#8212; like premium channels, a better DVR, support for unlimited screens and other channel bundles &#8212; a service like Hulu + Live TV could end up costing over $100 per month. By making an Unlimited DVR part of the base plan, Hulu + Live TV will seem competitive when compared with both pay TV and its direct competitor, YouTube TV, which comes with an unlimited amount of cloud DVR storage for all users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hulu + Live TV is <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/what-is-hulu-live-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on its own for $68.99 per month or in a bundle with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $69.99 per month (or $75.99 per month without ads.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gaming giant Ubisoft has confirmed a cybersecurity incident that led to the mass-reset of company passwords, but has declined to say what the incident actually was.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3tSsBh25mhHhlbGSy1xbRw/ubisoft-cyber-security-incident-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a brief statement</a>, Ubisoft said: &#8220;Last week, Ubisoft experienced a cyber security incident that caused temporary disruption to some of our games, systems, and services. Our IT teams are working with leading external experts to investigate the issue. As a precautionary measure we initiated a company-wide password reset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, we can confirm that all our games and services are functioning normally and that at this time there is no evidence any player personal information was accessed or exposed as a by-product of this incident,&#8221; the statement said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283505" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The France-headquartered video game company is best known for its Assassin&#8217;s Creed and Far Cry brands. According to the company&#8217;s latest earnings report from October, Ubisoft had 117 million active players.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/03/stockx-hacked-millions-records/">initiate password resets</a> when there is a concern that user passwords or employee credentials could have been compromised.</p>
<p>TechCrunch sent several questions to Ubisoft, including asking the company to describe the nature of the cybersecurity incident, such as whether it was a breach of its network; and if the company has the means, such as logs, to detect evidence of improper data access or exfiltration. Having logs would allow the company to know with a higher degree of certainty if data was exfiltrated, rather than having no logs and no evidence.</p>
<p>A Ubisoft spokesperson said the company had &#8220;nothing additional to share&#8221; regarding the incident.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><em>If you know more about the Ubisoft cyber incident or work at the company, get in touch with the security desk  on Signal and WhatsApp at +1 646-755-8849 or zack.whittaker@techcrunch.com by email. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In a further expansion of its policy responses to Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine, YouTube has said it&#8217;s now blocking Kremlin-backed media outlets globally &#8212; not just in Europe where two Russia state-affiliated channels, Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, along with their subsidiaries, were sanctioned by the European Union last week. This goes above and beyond [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a further expansion of its policy responses to Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine, YouTube has said it&#8217;s now blocking Kremlin-backed media outlets globally &#8212; not just in Europe where two Russia state-affiliated channels, Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik, along with their subsidiaries, were sanctioned by the European Union <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/02/eu-rt-sputnik-ban-live/">last week</a>.</p>
<p>This goes above and beyond any legal mandates to block this content &#8212; but is not entirely unprecedented; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/apple-pulls-russian-state-owned-media-outlets-rt-and-sputnik-from-global-app-stores/">last week</a> Apple pulled RT and Sputnik&#8217;s apps from its global App Stores following a request by Ukrainian vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who <a href="https://www.imore.com/ukraine-requests-apple-stop-product-sales-and-access-app-store-russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a letter</a> to CEO Tim Cook asking Apple to stop device sales in Russia and block access to the App Store entirely. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/apple-halts-product-sales-in-russia-following-ukraine-invasion/">Apple also halted product sales in Russia</a>.)</p>
<p>That said, YouTube&#8217;s wording suggests it <em>may</em> be going further than barring the six (in total) RT and Sputnik entities the EU has sanctioned &#8212; as the company writes that it&#8217;s now &#8220;blocking access to YouTube channels associated with Russian state-funded media globally&#8221;. (We&#8217;ve asked for clarification on the extent of the ban.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2283446" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ In line with that, we are also now blocking access to YouTube channels associated with Russian state-funded media globally, expanding from across Europe. This change is effective immediately, and we expect our systems to take time to ramp up.</p>
<p>&mdash; YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1502335085122666500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While the expanded YouTube blocks on Russia state media are &#8220;effective immediately&#8221;, per an update to the policy the platform just <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeInsider/status/1502335085122666500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> out, it also warns it may take time for the change to take effect &#8212; writing that &#8220;we expect our systems to take time to ramp up&#8221;.</p>
<p>In another new step, YouTube says it will be carrying out Ukraine-focused enforcement of certain existing policies from its Community Guidelines &#8212; which prohibit content that denies, minimizes or trivializes &#8220;well-documented violent events&#8221;, noting: &#8220;We are now removing content about Russia’s invasion in Ukraine that violates this policy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stepping up enforcement here &#8212; which is presumably the new thing (given the policies themselves aren&#8217;t new) &#8212; looks intended to respond to the fast-flowing Russian propaganda that&#8217;s being churned out to deny the reality of reports of what&#8217;s going on inside Ukraine.</p>
<p>Such as around the recent bombing of a maternity and children&#8217;s hospital in the port city of Mariupol &#8212; which Russian outlets quickly targeted with conspiracy theories &#8212; including implying victims depicted in photos and video are actors or <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-embassy-pushes-conspiracy-theory-about-mariupol-victim-s7wncxcqn?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=ukarine&amp;utm_medium=branded_social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">otherwise staging their injuries</a>. They also put out <a href="https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/1502199817883238400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similarly fake claims</a> that the hospital itself was a legitimate target because it had been emptied of patients and staff by a battalion of Ukrainian fighters who had taken up sniping positions there.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also reached out to YouTube with questions about the wider context around this enforcement announcement.</p>
<p>YouTube said that since its last update on Ukraine-related actions, it has removed more than 1,000 channels and over 15,000 videos for violating a number of policies &#8212; including its hate speech policy, policies around misinformation, graphic content and more.</p>
<p>It is also looking to signal progress on <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/helping-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously announced</a> measures to amplify &#8220;quality&#8221; information about the war &#8212; i.e. to help truthful reporting rise above Kremlin propaganda &#8212; saying there&#8217;s been some 17 million+ views on &#8220;trusted news sources&#8221; in Ukraine since it made changes directing users to this content (via breaking news and &#8220;top news&#8221; sections of its homepage).</p>
<p>In a further step targeting YouTube users in Russia, the platform has also confirmed that it&#8217;s extended the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/04/google-microsoft-sales-pause-russia/">recent pause on YouTube (and Google) ads</a> in the country to also cover all of the ways users could monetize on the platform &#8212; cutting off all revenue generating opportunities. Previously YouTube had left some monetization options open to Russian users.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/google-play-youtube-payment-pause-russia/">Yesterday</a> Google also said it&#8217;s suspending Play Store billing and YouTube payments in Russia as a result of Western sanctions targeting Russian banks.</p>
